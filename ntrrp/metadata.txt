about=This plugin is part of a project to provide high resolution burnt area mapping in northern Australia through the active fire season.
Acknowledgment: The development of the plugin was supported by a Northern Territory Government grant (NTRRP) though the National Risk Reduction Framework initiative. It initially was produced in partnership with Bushfires NT, NT Police, Fire & Emergency Services and the Darwin Centre for Bushfire Research to support strategic fuel reduction activities and emergency response for the greater Darwin and Katherine areas.
