# NAFI Fire Maps QGIS Plug-in

North Australia & Rangelands Fire Information (NAFI) Map Services

This plug-in for [QGIS](https://qgis.org) adds a directory of NAFI web services which provide accurate 250m scale fire scar (burnt area) mapping across most of the Australian rangelands.

The service provides annual and multi-year fire histories from 2000 to the present. The data are validated in the northern rangelands.

A cleaned up hotspot dataset for the rangelands back to 2000 is also provided.

The plug-in is quite simple to use, but Rohan Fisher has provided a brief demonstration video [here](https://twitter.com/RohanFisher4/status/1313370053937516550).

Reports of any issues and pull requests are very welcome.
