  <p>This plugin provides an easy method to search and discover fire mapping layers from the Northern Australia and
    rangelands Fire Information (NAFI) program, and upload them to the QGIS map window. The Open Geospatial Compliant
    (OGC) WMS layers represent fire activity based on information from satellites, such as hotspots (locations of
    recently burning fires) and fire scars (maps of recently burnt country). The maps are displayed to meet the needs of
    north Australian and remote area fire managers.</p>
  <p>Hotspots are sourced from Landgate Western Australia and Geoscience Australia (from NOAA and NASA satellites).
    Firescars are sourced from the Darwin Centre for Bushfires Research at Charles Darwin University (for NT and
    northern WA fire scars) and from FNQ Spatial Data Services (for Queensland).
