about=This plug-in copies currently selected features in the map view to a target layer with a single click or Hotkey and commits them to the edit on that layer. 
   It also includes a copy-paste hot-key configuration. It's intended for intensive human moderation of feature data. 
   Originally developed for mapping burnt areas from Object-Based Image Analysis (OBIA) polygons.
